The Adventurer picks 2 of the 3 main [[Classes]].

# Partial Expert

Is treated mostly like a full [[The Expert|Expert]], gaining the [[The Expert#Class Abilities#Quick Learner|Quick Learner]] ability. But they **do not** get the [[The Expert#Class Abilities#Masterful Expertise#|Masterful Expertise]] ability.

# Partial Mage

Is treated like a [[The Mage|Mage]], gaining the [[The Mage#Class Abilities#Arcane Tradition|Arcane Tradition]] ability. The tradition will be limited for Partial Mages, as described in their entries. It's possible to pick the Partial Mage class twice for two different traditions, gaining the limited benefits of both. If so, they use the full [[The Mage]] chart for hit dice, attack bonus, [[Foci]] and the spellcasting table if both partial classes cast spells. A Partial Mage must adhere to the restrictions and limits of the magical traditions chosen in order to use their abilities, regardless of what other partial class they have.

# Partial Warrior

Gains certain benefitis of a full [[The Warrior|Warrior]], including the improved hit die and somewhat improved attack bonus. They **do not** have the [[The Warrior#Class Abilities#Veteran's Luck|Veteran's Luck]] ability or [[The Warrior#Class Abilities#Killing Blow|Killing Blow]].
