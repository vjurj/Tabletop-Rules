# Spells and cantrips
4 level 2 spell slots
2 level 2 spell slots

Choose three cantrips from the cleric spell list. Choose a number of cleric spells equal to your WIS modifier + your cleric level (3) (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a WIS of 16 (+3), your list of prepared spells can include 6 (3 from cleric level + 3 from WIS modifier) spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

# Spellcasting Ability

WIS is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your WIS modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus (2) + your WIS modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus (2) + your WIS modifier

You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

# Channel Divinity

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

## Channel Divinity: Turn Undead

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

## Channel Divinity: Preserve Life
As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore 15 hit points. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct.

# Disciple of Life
Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.
