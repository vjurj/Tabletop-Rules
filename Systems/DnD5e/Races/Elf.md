Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were  bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You  can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.  

Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Percep-  
tion skill.  

Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws  
against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.  
Trance. Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they medi-  
tate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day.  
(The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”)  
While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such  
dreams are actually mental exercises that have become  
reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this  
way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8  
hours of sleep.  

Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common  
and Elvish.
