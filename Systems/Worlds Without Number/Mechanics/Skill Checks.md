The hero is assumed to be competent at all the ordinary functions of their role and background. A moisture farmer from a desert would know how to keep a dew still running and how to pun on a stillsuit. A corporate magnate's daughter from a megacorp hiveworld would know how to read a balance sheet and speak during a C-level executive meeting.

Heroes shouldn't fail at those basic tasks related to their usual experience, unless something makes the task especially difficult.

To make a skill check, roll 2d6 and add the most relevant skill level and attribute modifier. For example, lifting a heavy rock might be a Str/Exert check while running a marathon may be a Con/Exert check. If there are multiple applicable skills for the check, the player may choose which of them to use. 

Matching or beating the check's difficulty means that the character succeeds, failing to do so means that the character fails or succeeds at a cost.

If the character doesn't even have level-0 in the required skill, they suffer a **-1** to the roll

# Table
 
|Difficulty|Description|
|---|---|
|6|A relatively simple task that is still more than the PC would usually be expected to manage in their regular background. Anything easier than this isn’t worth a skill check.|
|8|A significant challenge to a competent professional that they’d still succeed at more often than not.|
|10|Something too difficult to be expected of anyone but a skilled expert, and even they might fail.|
|12|Only a true master could expect to carry this off with any degree of reliability.|
|14 +|Only a true master has any chance of achieving this at all, and even they will probably fail.|

Particularly helpful circumstances may give a bonus up to **+2** to the skill check, while bad circumstances may give a penalty up to **-2**.

# Aiding a skill check

A PC may aid another when attempting a difficult check. The aiding player describes how they are helping and if the GM aggrees that it makes sense, the player rolls a relevant skill check against the same difficulty as the original check. If it's a success, the other PC gains a **+1** bonus to their roll.

Multiple PCs can try to help, but the main PC can't earn more than a **+1** total bonus. The helping skill doesn't necessarily have to be the same skill as the main PC is checking, for example, a [[Sneak]] check may be aided by a [[Convince]] check.
