# Fire Bolt

| Level      | Casting Time | Range/Area | Components | Duration | Attack/Save| Damage/Effect|
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Cantrip | 1 Action | 120 ft|V, S|Instantaneous|Ranged|Fire|

You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn't being worn or carried.

# Mage Hand

| Level      | Casting Time | Range/Area | Components | Duration | Attack/Save| Damage/Effect|
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Cantrip | 1 Action | 30 ft|V, S|1 Minute|None|Utility|

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.

You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.

The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

# Minor Illusion

| Level      | Casting Time | Range/Area | Components | Duration | Attack/Save| Damage/Effect|
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Cantrip | 1 Action | 30 ft|S, M|1 Minute|None|Control|

You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.

If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

If you create an image of an object--such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest--it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

# Alarm

| Level      | Casting Time | Range/Area | Components | Duration | Attack/Save| Damage/Effect|
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st | 1 Minute Ritual| 30 ft|V, S, M|8 Hours|None|Detection|

You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.

A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.

An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.

# Burning Hands

| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st | 1 Action|Self (15 ft cone)|V, S|Instantaneous|DEX Save|Fire|

As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

| 1st | 1 Action Ritual|Self (30 ft sphere)|V, S|Concentration 10 Minutes|None|Detection|

For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot level above 1st.
