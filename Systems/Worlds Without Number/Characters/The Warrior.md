# Class Abilities

## Killing Blow

When a Warrior deals damage with any attack, spell or special ability, they may add half their character level **rounded up** to the damage done. The damage is also added to any Shock inflicted. This ability is very powerful with [[Foci]] meant to improve [[Shock]] attacks.

## Veteran's Luck

Once per scene, as an Instant action, the Warrior may turn a missed attack into a hit. Or they can turn a successful attack against them into a miss, as an Instant action as well. Both options can **not** be used at the same time, as it's only once per scene. A Warrior may use this ability with crew-served weapons they are assisting in firing. This ability can **not** be used to negate environmental damage or damage done to a vehicle/mount they are riding.
