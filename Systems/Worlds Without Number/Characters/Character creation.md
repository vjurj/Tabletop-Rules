# Background

Pick from the list of [[Backgrounds]], then choose **one** method of getting [[Skills]]:
- Gain the background's listed quick skills
- Pick two skills from the background's Learning table, except for "Any Skill"
- Roll **three** times, splitting the rolls between the Growth and Learing tables of the background

The "Any Combat" skill can be used to choose either "Stab", "Shoot" or "Punch" while "Any Skill" can be used to get any skill on the list. When gaining a new skill, it will be at level-0. Gaining a skill again will upgrade it to level-1. If you need to choose a certain skill for the third time, get a new skill at level-0 or upgrade an existing level-0 one to level-1.
If rolling randomly of the Growth table gives an attribute bonus, choose as following:
- Str, Dex or Con in the case of Physical Attributes
- Int, Wis, Cha in the case of Mental Attributes

No attribute can be raised above 18. A +2 bonus to an attribute may be split between 2 different attributes

# Class

Choose a [[Classes|Class]].

# Roll starting Hit Points

Roll to determine the initial maximum HP. If they reach 0, the character will be mortally wounded. The die rolled depends on the class. Add the CON modifier to the roll, with a minimum of 1 point of HP regardless of the penalty. 

# Pick a free skill

Pick a skill of your choice, gaining it at level-0. Or upgrade an existing skill to level-1. This ability **can not** be used to improve an existing level-1 skill to level-2.

# Record the Attack Bonus

This bonus is based on the class chosen and is mentioned in the class's table.

# Choose starting spells 

Full [[The Mage|Mages]] begin play by choosing 4 first level [[Spells]]. [[The Adventurer#Partial Mage|Partial Mages]] begin by choosing 2. Adventurers with two Partial Mage classes know 4 spells as well. 

# Record starting languages

Characters begin with knowledge of their native language, Trade Cant and fluency in additional ones based on their [[Skills#Connect]] and [[Skills#Know]] skill levels. Level-0 in either grants one more language and level-1 grants two. 

For example, having Connect-1 and Know-1 means that the character is fluent in their native language, Trade Cant and 4 additional languages of their choice. Spending a few months immersed in a culture or gaining an additional level in either of those 2 skills will grant an additional language each time.

# Choose starting equipment

Pick either a starting equipment package or roll 3d6x10 for starting silver pieces.

# Record weapons and armor

The total hit point bonus is equal to the base attack bonus + the relevant Stab/Shoot/Punch skill + relevant attribute modifier of the weapon. If two attributes are listed for a weapon, use whichever is better. If you don't even have level-0 skill in a weapon, take a -2 to hit penalty with it.

Attribute modifiers are added to **both** damage rolls and Shock. Punch weapons or unarmed attacks can also add your Punch skill.

Record the AC of the armor used. Unarmored humans have an AC of **10**. AC is improved by the DEX modifier. 

# Pick a name, goal and ties
