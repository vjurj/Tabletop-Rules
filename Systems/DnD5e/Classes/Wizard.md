# Spellcasting Ability (INT)
Use your INT modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 10 + INT modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + INT modifier

You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

# Arcane Recovery 
Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can recover a 2nd level spell slot or 2 level 1 spell slots.

# Sculpt Spells
When casting an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.
