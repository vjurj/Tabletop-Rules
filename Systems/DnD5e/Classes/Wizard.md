# Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

-   (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus
-   (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack

# Spells and cantrips
4 level 2 spell slots
2 level 2 spell slots

Choose three cantrips from the wizard spell list. Choose a number of wizard spells equal to your INT modifier + your wizard level (3) (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an INT of 16 (+3), your list of prepared spells can include 6 (3 from wizard level + 3 from INT modifier) spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

# Spellcasting Ability

INT is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. You use your INT whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your INT modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus (2)+ your INT modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus (2) + your INT modifier

# Ritual Casting
You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.


# Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

# Arcane Recovery
Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.

# Sculpt Spells
You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.
