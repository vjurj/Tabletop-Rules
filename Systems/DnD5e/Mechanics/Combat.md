# Working together
The one with the highest ability modifier (or the one leading the effort) rolls with advantage

# Short rest (1+ hour)
Spend up to all your Hit Die at the end of the short rest. For each die rolled, add the CON modifier as well. Regain HP equal to the total (minimum of 0). After each roll, decide if you want to roll another dice.

# Long rest (8+ hours)
Regain all lost HP and up to half of the total hit dice. Can't have a long rest more than once in 24 hours.

# Combat surprise
When ambushed, roll Dex (Stealth) of one attacker vs passive Wisdom (Perception) of EACH defender. Each surprised character can not move, take actions or reactions. A character may be surprised even if the other allies are not.

# Initiative
At the beginning of combat, roll d20 + DEX modifier for each character. Groups of identical creatures roll only once, for the whole group. Initiative goes from highest to lowest.

# Actions
Usually, make a MOVE action and one ACTION per turn. You can also use one reaction and one bonus action.

## Move
You can move up to your movement speed and you can split your move (for example, move a bit, attack, use the rest of your movement speed). You may split your move even between multiple attacks. Moving in difficult terrain counts as 1 extra foot for each foot moved. You may drop prone for free, but moving while crawling/prone costs 1 extra foot as well. Standing up from being prone costs half of your maximum movement speed.

## Dash
You may use the Dash action to gain extra movement this turn, equal to your speed after modifiers.

## Disengage
Your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn. 

## Bonus action
Certain abilities allow you to take a bonus action, otherwise you don't have any. After using a bonus action, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. 

## Reaction
Reactions are special responses to situation triggers, usually attacks of opportunity. After using a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn.

## Ready
Use the Ready action if you want to delay an action for when a specific situation triggers it (eg: Shoot at the first enemy that enters the room). When the trigger happens, you may spend your reaction to do what you have readied or you can just ignore the trigger. 

You may also ready a spell. This requires concentrating on it, so a currently concentrated spell gets cancelled. If you take damage before casting the readied spell, you may lose concentration.

## Dodge
Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll against you has disadvantage and you have advantage with DEX saving throws

## Help
Help an ally, giving them advantage on the next ability check you are helping with. If helping them to attack, your ally can make the first attack roll before the next turn with advantage.

## Hide
Make a DEX (Stealth) check if there are opportunities to hide. If you succeed, you make yourself unseen.

## Search
When trying to find something, make a WIS (Perception) or INT (Investigation) check.

# Attacking
## Melee
Attack roll: d20 + STR mod + 2 (if you are proficient with the weapon)

Damage roll: d20 + STR mod

### Attacking with 2 weapons
Use a bonus action to attack with the offhand weapon. Don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, only if it's negative.

## Ranged
Attack roll: d20 + DEX mod + 2 (if you are proficient with the weapon)

Damage roll: d20 + DEX mod

If weapon has a single range, you can't attack further.
If weapon has two ranges (normal and long), attacks made between normal and long range are rolled with disadvantage. You can't attack further than long range

If you make a ranged attack (with weapon, with spell, etc) in close combat, roll the attack roll with disadvantage if within 5 feet of a hostile creature.

## Critical hit
Roll all attack damage dice twice, sum them up and add the modifiers just once, at the end.

# Casting a spell
