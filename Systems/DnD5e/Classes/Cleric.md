# Spellcasting Ability (WIS)

Use your WIS modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 10 + WIS modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = 2 + WIS modifier

You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. 

You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

# Channel Divinity

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

## Channel Divinity: Turn Undead

As an action, each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a WIS saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

## Channel Divinity: Preserve Life
As an action, choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide 15 hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct.

# Disciple of Life
Whenever you use a non-cantrip spell to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.
